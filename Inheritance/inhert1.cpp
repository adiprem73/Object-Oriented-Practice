/*
INHERITANCE IN C++
1. reusability is a very important feature in OOPs.
2. the concept of resuability in cpp is supported using inheritance
3. Base Class: the existing class is called base class
4. Derived Class: the new class which is inherited is called as derived class
5. forms of inheritance in cpp
        ðŸ˜‰single inheritance : a derived class with only one base class   A---->B    A derives B
        ðŸ˜‰multiple inheritance : a derived class with more than one Base class    A---->c    B---->C    A and B deribes C
        ðŸ˜‰Heirarchical Inheritance: several derived classes from a single base class    A---->B    A------>C    A derives both B and C
        ðŸ˜‰Multilevel Inheritance: deriving a class from already deriuved class    A---->B----->C
        ðŸ˜‰Hybrid Inheritance : combination of multiplle inheritance and multilevel inhertiance
